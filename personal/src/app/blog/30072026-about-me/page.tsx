        <div className="disclaimer">This post was written with AI assistance. The story, the memories, and the words are entirely my own, but writing about my past isn&apos;t easy, and my first draft was raw and disjointed. I wrote down everything as it came to me, then asked an AI to help me shape it into something clearer and easier to read. Every detail here is true and mine; AI simply helped me tell it well.</div>
        <p>
          I’ve realised that I’ve never really shared my past with many people in its
          full, uncensored context, or explained how much it has shaped the person I am
          today. This is a difficult story to tell, and while some parts are painful to
          revisit, I believe it is important to acknowledge where I came from and how
          far I have travelled since then.
          <br />
          <br />
          This is not just a story about the things that happened to me. It is also a
          story about rebuilding, finding myself, and creating a life where I can feel
          safe and accepted.
        </p>
        <h3>My Past</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Ages 0–4:</b> I was born in Exeter, England, and spent the first
          few years of my life there. After my sibling was born, my early
          childhood became increasingly difficult. Between the ages of 2 and 4,
          I experienced child sexual abuse and neglect from the people who were
          supposed to protect me: my biological parents. The people who brought
          me into the world and were meant to keep me safe became the source of
          my trauma. It took the actions of a postman, who noticed something was
          wrong and contacted the police, for my sibling and I to be removed
          from that situation and given the chance to be safe. These experiences
          had a lasting impact on me. They contributed to the development of the
          mental health struggles I experience today, including CPTSD,
          depression, and anxiety.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Ages 4–14:</b> Life after that point became safer. My sibling and I
          provided statements to the police, and while the legal process has
          continued for many years, we were able to begin rebuilding our lives.
          After being adopted at the age of 6, I began experiencing my first
          feelings of gender dysphoria. At the time, I didn’t understand what
          those feelings meant. I assumed they were just part of growing up or
          connected to the trauma I had experienced. I believed I was living a
          normal, safe life, even though there were parts of myself I had not
          yet understood.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Ages 15–17:</b> During my teenage years, I began to understand that
          I was transgender. This realisation was an important part of
          understanding myself, but it also brought new challenges. Despite
          being adopted by a lesbian couple, I experienced transphobia within my
          home environment. It left me feeling unsafe, isolated, and unable to
          be fully open about who I was. The pressure eventually became
          overwhelming, leading to my first major breakdown. I began making
          choices that were harmful to myself as a way of coping. I became
          reckless, started using substances, and struggled to find healthy ways
          to process everything I was feeling. At 16, I reached a point where I
          attempted to take my own life. Since then, suicidal thoughts have
          remained something I have had to work through, but I continue choosing
          to move forward one day at a time. After coming out to my parents, I
          experienced further harm through emotional, financial, and physical
          abuse. Eventually, university became my opportunity to leave that
          environment and find somewhere I could finally feel safe and
          supported.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>18–Present:</b> Moving to university was the beginning of a new
          chapter in my life. After the Christmas break, I made the difficult
          decision to distance myself from my parents because their treatment of
          me had reached a point where my wellbeing and medical safety were at
          risk. They attempted to interfere with my medication despite knowing
          the consequences of stopping it. They believed I was making them
          appear worse than they were, but I knew I needed to prioritise my own
          safety and future. Leaving was painful, but it allowed me to build a
          life where I could finally feel secure, accepted, and able to be
          myself.
        </p>
        <h3>How This Affects Me Now</h3>
        <p>
          As I continue moving forward, I’m grateful for the lessons I’ve
          learned and for the people who have supported me throughout my
          journey. The friendships and connections I have built have shown me
          what genuine care and acceptance look like. The loss of family
          relationships has been difficult, and I continue to live with the
          effects of CPTSD and BPD. These conditions bring challenges, including
          periods of depression, anxiety, and emotional instability. They are
          things I continue learning to manage rather than things that define
          who I am. Coding has become one of the ways I look after my mental
          health. It gives me something to focus on, helps me stay grounded, and
          allows me to create and connect with others. Being part of online
          communities has also helped me feel less alone and has given me people
          who genuinely care about my wellbeing. I still have difficult days. I
          still experience setbacks and moments where things feel overwhelming.
          But I have also grown, adapted, and built a support system around me
          that reminds me I am not facing everything alone. My past has shaped
          me, but it does not control my future. I am still here, still
          learning, and still becoming the person I want to be.
        </p>
        <h3>Further Reading</h3>
        <p>
        
        Before writing this full account of my life, I shared a smaller part of my story through TransActual in 2024, focusing specifically on my experiences with transphobia, coming out, and how music became an escape and a way for me to reclaim myself.
        
        If you would like to read more about that part of my journey, you can find that article here:
        <br />
        <a href="https://transactual.org/2024/11/04/how-music-helped-me-escape-abuse-and-reclaim-myself/"><i>How Music Helped Me Escape Abuse and Reclaim Myself</i></a>
        <br />
        This was written before I began sharing my story in its full context, so it focuses more on my experiences as a trans person facing rejection and abuse rather than the wider experiences that shaped me before that point.

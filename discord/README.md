# We Have Moved

I made this page for my partner **@doughmination** to put on  
`discord.butterfly-network.win` to let people know that the service has moved to:

https://discord.doughmination.win

It’s a simple static site meant to clearly communicate the move and avoid confusion from old links or bookmarks.

If you like my work, feel free to ⭐ star this repo and follow my <a href="https://github.com/ariarees">GitHub</a> 🙂

Also used on https://setup.doughmination.win

<b>Note: If you are using this page yourself, the 404 page automatically redirects to the root domain (/), so change that if needed.</b>
